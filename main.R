#one game seems to suck a lot more than the others, only one is profitable at at 30. 
# ULC: can we drive down CPI drastically? do we become profitable at 90+? 
# ULC: why so much spend? is it an older game? did we tap out audience / using old profits to pay for growth?
# ULH: seems to have a much lower spend? is it a newer game or is it CPI bidding related? almost profts
# ULH: there must be a profitable campaign or network here to be more aggressive in?
# ULM: Profitable after 30 days. highest CPI - maybe somethingn to cut to increase profits. 
# I haven't really looked at cohorts / retention yet. 30 days seems like a good target for profitable
# would love to know if there are "addicts"

# BLUE - IOS - ULH is not present?!?
# GREEN - Something is off here, why is IOS so much better (we already know ULC sucks)
# GREEN - Low spending on Green, don't really care that much about it, if I need to cut some fat... 
# BLUE - ULC - bulk of spend is here, has better than ULC global ROAS + bigger CPI... 
# BLUE - ULC - Android - seems to be the winner for this guy, are we testing the other or are they getting weened off?
# BLUE - ULC - IOS - weird how ULC is the only one with a drastic difference between os in BLUE
# RED - Similar performance but better (Red - ULM - Android = amazing) here if we ignore ULC 
# Need to dig into Blue for ULC / take a look at campaigns or countries for Red/Blue for ULM/ULH to see if strong performance
# Green just smells like fraud
